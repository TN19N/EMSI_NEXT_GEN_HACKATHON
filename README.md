# LetBeLeet

an extraordinary project that draws inspiration from the renowned 42network pedagogy - a problem-based learning platform that promises to revolutionize the way we approach education.

Our journey began with a fundamental realization: often, we don't know what we don't know. Traditional educational systems can leave us with knowledge gaps, hindering our progress and potential. That's where our solution steps in - to bridge this crucial gap and provide a transformative learning experience.

At LetBeLeet, we are dedicated to offering an innovative approach to learning. Our platform is designed to identify and address the unknowns within a student's knowledge, guiding them towards deeper understanding and personal growth. We believe in the power of learning by doing, and thus, we focus on practical problem-solving rather than rote memorization.

Imagine a world where students are encouraged to grapple with real-world challenges, engaging in collaborative problem-solving and critical thinking. Through this process, they gain a clear understanding of their strengths and weaknesses. Our platform leverages personalized testing to provide invaluable feedback, empowering students to refine their knowledge and skills continuously.

Our solution goes beyond traditional testing methodologies. Instead of merely evaluating students, we use assessment as a tool to illuminate their unique path towards improvement. By identifying weaknesses and areas of development, we create tailored learning opportunities that foster growth and inspire achievement.
